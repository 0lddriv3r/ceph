* MGR: progress module can now be turned on/off, using the commands:
  ``ceph progress on`` and ``ceph progress off``.

* The structured output of ``ceph status`` or ``ceph -s`` is now more
  concise, particularly the ``mgrmap`` and ``monmap`` sections, and the
  structure of the ``osdmap`` section has been cleaned up.
