14.2.9
------

* Bucket notifications now support Kafka endpoints. This requires librdkafka of
  version 0.9.2 and up. Note that Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus) has an older
  version of librdkafka, and would require an update to the library.

* The pool parameter ``target_size_ratio``, used by the pg autoscaler,
  has changed meaning. It is now normalized across pools, rather than
  specifying an absolute ratio. For details, see :ref:`pg-autoscaler`.
  If you have set target size ratios on any pools, you may want to set
  these pools to autoscale ``warn`` mode to avoid data movement during
  the upgrade::

    ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_autoscale_mode warn
